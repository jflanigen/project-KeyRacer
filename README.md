> User will press a button labeled 'CONTINUE' when ready

After a countdown from 3, user will copy words that are prompted to them live
> Submitting each word upon the user's word matching in length to that of the correct word.

Once all words have been copied, post game menu will provide user with a cyclical display of their entered word and the matching.
> User will also be provided with WPM from game session, accuracy of input on a character-by-character basis, and the number of words from their session.

A restart button will allow the user to return to the main menu and proceed with another session, if they so please.
